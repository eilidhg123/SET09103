This web app is a prototype.

Given more time and resources there would be many more features and elements to this web app, however the prototype presented represents examples of these features and elements, and could be used to expand upon and add more detail and code to in order to create a fully finction web app.

Naturally the main improement would be to include more in the guide, but again due to time constraints I decided that it would be best to focus on other elements of the web app rather than spending too much tim focusing on this.
